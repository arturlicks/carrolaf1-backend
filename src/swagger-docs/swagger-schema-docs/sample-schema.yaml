# Sample Schema YAML File

# This is a sample schema YAML file (sample-schema.yaml) to demonstrate the structure for documenting your API.

# To organize your schemas effectively, create separate YAML files for each schema (e.g., user-schema.yaml, course-schema.yaml), each handling specific responsibilities.

# Import these YAML files into your swagger.ts or swagger.js file to consolidate your API documentation.

# Example:
components:
  schemas:
    User:
      type: object
      required:
        - name
        - email
        - password
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
          description: Name of the user
        email:
          type: string
          description: Email address of the user
          format: email
        password:
          type: string
          description: User's password (hashed, not returned by default)
          format: password
        avatar:
          type: object
          properties:
            public_id:

              description: Public ID of the user's avatar
            url:

          description: Avatar of the user
        role:
          type: string
          description: Role of the user, defaults to "user"

            properties:
              courseId:
                type: string
                description: The course ID associated with the user
        createdAt:
          type: string
          format: date-time
